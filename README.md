### Hi there 👋

I am a Full-stack developer in training. So far I have touched on HTML with CSS and JavaScript. 
My interest in tech started recently working as a Lab Facilitator. And during the course, I got introduced to programming.
I am always eager to learn anything that helps me grow and solve problems, and I always thrive on writing clean and reusable code.
I consider myself to be a hard worker who is eager to learn new things. I'm commited to learning new technologies and languages.
