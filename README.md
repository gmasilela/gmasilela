### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-stack developer in training. So far I have touched on HTML with CSS and JavaScript. 

My interest in tech started recently working as a Lab Facilitator. And during the course, I got introduced to programming.

I wrote my first 'hello world' in HTML and I therefore realized that this path is the one I want to lean on.

I am always eager to learn anything that helps me grow and solve problems, and I always thrive on writing clean and reusable code.
